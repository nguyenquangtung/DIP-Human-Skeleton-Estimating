# Human-Skeleton-Estimating
Link video demo: https://youtu.be/DQVGjCHT1J4
This video is my Final Project (Image Processing Course) about: HUMAN SKELETON ESTIMATING FROM IMAGE (VIDEO) USING IMAGE PROCESSING AND PATTERN RECOGNITION TECHNIQUES

﻿# About project
With the rapid development of Digital Image Processing. Loads of methods, techniques, libraries,… have been produced to serve human’s needs. In this project we will use Image processing which performs some operations on an image, in order to get the human skeleton estimation from the image or frame (from video). But before that, we need to apply Pattern recognition so that the app will automatically detect human parts by using machine learning algorithms.


This is list of used libraries
